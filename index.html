        <h3>End of Project Reflection</h3>
        <h4>Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design - Which scenes or actions in your storyboard (or frames in your animation blocking) did you work for this project?  Draw (insert screenshot, whiteboard photo, or digital drawing) and/or describe them below.  What character and set/mechanical design elements did you personally create, use, and/or modify for your project?   </h4>
        <p>I helped to create the red bear (nurse), frog (doctor), and the shelf in the background. I helped to modify the chair so that it could bare the weight of the bear during scenes in which the bear was sitting on it. I helped to modify the main bear when he became sad by adding a tear.
        <h4>Technology and Code - What software and/or hardware technologies did you create, revise, and/or use for this project?  For example, how specifically did you use the photography and Dragonframe software and hardware?  How specifically did you create, revise, and/or use code for your programmed device for controlling lights and/or motion? </h4>
        <p>We used the camera and tripod, as well as the Dragonframe control board and software on the computer. We used the Dragonframe software in order to line up the images we had (onion skin feature) and to shoot new pictures to include in our stop motion. We deployed the code from Makecode to the Crickit, and used the Crickit to provide basic lighting for the set. We set it to a high brightness by pushing the button multiple times and dimmed it as needed so that there would be contrast in lighting between the happy and sad emotions our character was experiencing.  </p>
        <h4>Social Impact, Audience, and 5 Whys - How did your work with your characters, set, storyboard, and technology help create a physical animation that will make a difference on the social issue you are trying to address?  How and why will it affect your intended audience? </h4>
        <p>We made our characters animals with human-like features so that their experiences would radiate relativity in terms of our human audience; for example, in the scene where the bear receives the bill, we changed his facial expressions to better convey his emotions to the audience. The Dragonframe and camera technology helped us to capture our project, and therefore, will help create a physical animation that will make a difference because without those technologies our story and social issue would not be able to be displayed to the greater public. This will affect our intended audience in that they will be able to grasp the greater message at a greater magnitude because they are able to view it from a different medium– stop-motion animation. </p>
